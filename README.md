Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
In this project, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Titanic" dataset. EDA involves analyzing the data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. Here, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights using various visualization techniques.

Steps for EDA
Load and Understand the Data
Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis
Multivariate Analysis
Visualization of Findings

Explanation
Load and Understand the Data: Load the dataset and display initial data, information, and summary statistics.
Univariate Analysis: Explore the distribution of individual features.
Histograms for numerical features like Age and Fare.
Count plots for categorical features like Pclass and Survived.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between two features.
Box plots for Age by Pclass and Survived.
Count plots for Pclass and Sex by Survived.
Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships involving more than two features.
Correlation heatmap for numerical features.
Pair plot for Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived.
Further Insights and Visualizations: Additional insights based on age groups and fare groups.
Count plots for AgeGroup and FareGroup by Survived.
This code provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, using various visualization techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights.
